# Advanced Geocomputing and Geospatial Bigdata Analytics
<p>The repository serves as a portfolio for geospatial analysis with Python. Python code presented in the repository is completed as part of academic work and reflects the usage of near real-time data (Jan - May 2023). I took Geog 573 during Spring 2023, and the course was taught by <a href = "https://geography.wisc.edu/staff/gao-song/"> Professor Song Gao</a>, a renowned professor in the geospatial data science domain and director of <a href = "https://geography.wisc.edu/geods/">GeoDS Lab</a> in the department of Geography, University of Wisconsin - Madison. The repository is made public for geospatial enthusiasts and students seeking knowledge in the intersectoral domain of Geography + Computer Science.</p>
